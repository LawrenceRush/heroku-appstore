# heroku-appstore

Problem addressed - Employers needing a store page with multiple options and functional cart to add items too.

App organization - The app is orgainized into a server file (backend funtionality) and a client file(front end). Express and node mainly comprise the backend, recieving requests and altering a mongoDB collection accordingly. The front end is react, which uses conditional rendering to swich between store and cart pages. 

Instructions - Hit add to cart on apps you want to download and then hit the shopping cart to see the app you have accumulated.
